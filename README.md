<h1>Bonsai-Discord-Bot<h2>
<p style="font-size:0.8em;">Customize three different bonsai trees using parts (base, trunk, and leaves) from the marketplace and setting a background color. All users can upload these parts to the marketplace and earn money when someone buys from them. They can then replace the parts in trees with the ones in inventories whenever they like. There is, however, a max of 15 parts in each user's shop.</p>
